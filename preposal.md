# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

We are thinking about developing a website where the user plays a game of opening gifts depending on what they had on their wishlist. For example, this year they were hoping to get a hoodie, xbox, and amc gift card. We plan to have multiple buttons for each type of wishlist. It's hard to explain but let's just say they opened gifts and got something that they had in their wishlist and they like our selection, then by clicking on the image, it will forward them to either a website online or nearby store to purchase. If possible we will try to find the lowest price available to forward them to for the same time. And if not we will let the user know of other store prices and let the user know why we forwarded them to website.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
